\section{1) Reorganization of ME moves}
\subsection{A) Focus on Dish Config}
Inspired by "Reading Tea Leaves: How Humans Interpret Topic Models":\\
{\bf Focus on the latent space:}\\
1) How well is a certain restaurant explained by the dishes ?$\Rightarrow$ Decompose-Restaurant Move(lower level)\\
2) How representative are the dishes? $\Rightarrow$ Dish Refinement(higher level)\\ \\
So, we are going to do higher-level moves, directly refining dish config.
\subsection{B) Randomness and Efficiency}
For dish config refinement, now we have {\bf Decompose-Dish,Merge-Dish,Local-Dish},which are in decreased order in terms of complexity.\\ \\
0) Instead of doing the move for all dishes, we use a move for one dish at a time so that they are "light" enough to mix better.\\
1) We may need Randomness to choose a move s.t. Decompose-Dish is relatively less frequently.\\
2) In Decompose-Dish, we may want to decompose noiser dishes more frequently.\\
3) In Merge-Dish, we may want to merge smaller dishes more frequently.\\

\subsection{C) Pseudocode}
\begin{alltt}
  \(\%a)Initialization:\)
      Gibbs-Initialization

  \(\%b)Run for Convergence:\)
      While Likelihood doesn't increase any more:          
          Switch(randsample([1,2,3],weight_move))
              case 1:
              \(\%1)Local Word Refinement () :\)
                    Local-Word(randsample(dish))
              case 2:
              \(\%1)Merge Dish Refinement () :\)
                    weight~num of words in the dish
                    Merge-Dish(randsample(dish,weight))
              case 3:
              \(\%1)Decompose Dish Refinement () :\)
                    weight~-Likelihood/num of words in the dish
		    Decompose-Dish(randsample(dish,weight))
	  End
      End
\end{alltt}
\begin{enumerate}[i]
 \item Decompose-Dish:
\begin{enumerate}[a]
 \item In the beginning, Decompose-Restaurant(delete previous restaurant config) is used to get out of stuck given bad dishes.
 \item Later when the dishes become better, Decompose-Table(only delete tables with certain dish) is used for efficiency.
\end{enumerate}
 \item Merge-Dish: It may only be helpful in the beginning, when there tend to be many small dishes.
 \item Local-Word: 
\begin{enumerate}[a]
 \item Can be seen as a bigger version of Local-customer, where we try to reconfig one big "customer" in the dish
 \item A little drift away to Decompose-Word, we can delete the word configuration and resample+search 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section{2) Gibbs Sampling with FAIR INITIALIZATION}
\section{3) Results on Topic Model}
Here, I run Gibbs Sampling and ME algorithm on a synthetic data. 100 words and 200 documents.
Hungarian Algorithm to match similar topics with a hamming distance metric.
