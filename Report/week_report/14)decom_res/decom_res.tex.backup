\section{1) Algorithm}
GOAL: Maximize log Probability P=$log p(x,z|\lambda,\alpha,\gamma)$
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Make Restaurant j into one table t1 where customers following uniform distribution
\item Iterate until no customers are left in this uniform table t1:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each dish k, propose to form a new table$^{1*}$ out of t1 with dish k and calculate the weight $\Delta P$
\item Sample$^{2*}$ a proposal according to the weight and make the new table
\end{enumerate}
\item TKM$^{3*}$
\item Decision$^{4*}$
\end{enumerate}
{\bf NOTE:}:\\
$^{1*}$:One naive proposal is to assign customers with overlapped words between t1 and dish k to the new table. But actually, it is a only rough 
approximation of the "best" new table can be made by dish k: threshold $\frac{n_{..k}^{w}+\phi_{0}}{{n_{..k}+W\phi_{0}}}\sim\frac{n_{..k}^{w}}{n_{..k}}$ of the overlapped word w by $\frac{1}{W}$\\ \\
$^{2*}$:$\Delta P$ has nothing to do with Probability and different scalings lead to different functionality(variability or peaky)\\ \\
$^{3*}$:In practice, merge table may not be a good idea since it's a little too greedy while the dishes are still fledging. In Local Search k,
we can also restrict the tables not to have new dishes, forcing Restaurant j to be explained by old dishes.\\ \\
$^{4*}$ Accept all or Reject if decrease P

\section{2) Experiment}
\subsection{i)  Empirical Results}
$^{0*}$:In general, Decompose Restaurant can roughly find the bars from the darkness.\\ \\
$^{1*}$:Proposal with threshold works better. Simply we don't want to accumulate the noise in the dish .\\ \\
$^{2*}$:During Initialization, greedy assignment is better than sampling.\\ \\
$^{3*}$:Allowing new dishes in local search k works a little better.\\ \\
$^{4*}$:During Initialization, we'd better accept all new configurations which may decrease P by splitting up noisy tables.\\ \\
\subsection{ii) Problems{\small (left for Decompose Dish)}}
1) Decompose Restaurant(DR) cannot further purify the dishes.\\ \\
Since the algorithm only considers one new table at a time(a little greedy), it fails to favor pairs of dishes over one bigger dish.\\
Thus, if a mixture of bars happen several times, Decompose Restaurant may make it a dish even though the bars have been figured out elsewhere.\\ \\
Suppose Restaurant j contains the mixture of bars on the right in Figure 1. Though the words in dish right has smaller 
frequency, it rescues more of the uniform distributed words. Thus Restaurant j may not want to be explained by the other two dishes, even we do sampling.
